Formula 1 is a small, fictive formula 1 game & watch style lcd game with high score keeping. 
The Game was initially created over a decade ago for a small retrogame competition in delphi, after which it got ported to the gp2x in c/c++ then to Playdate and now to Vircon32. 
This version is based on the Playdate version but which has added high score saving compared to the original gp2x version.

### Graphics
All graphics are created by me, joyrider3774 aka Willems Davy initially in Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7 for the gp2x version later modified using GIMP.
The "handheld" is a graphically edited image of a picture taken of an LCD Handheld but i can't remember which one. It highly differs from its original.
Feel free to use the graphics as long as you credit me.
